General Description
A real-time platformer where a general purpose of the game is to destroy all of the pillars by killing all of the monsters in a room with a pillar 
and then defeat the final boss in the room with an exit at the center of the room. The dungeon where the hero travels was randomly generated using Kruskalâ€™s
and is set to be size 3 by 3, but can be modified to any size. In order to find controls, start the game, choose the hero and press ESC to see the Control Menu. 
Currently, three classes are available, each with separate special abilities. Press P to enable respawn.
